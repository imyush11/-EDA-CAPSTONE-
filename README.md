# -EDA-CAPSTONE-

In my exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism dataset, I undertook a structured approach to derive meaningful insights. The project began with data cleaning and manipulation, which involved handling missing and null values to ensure a robust dataset. I standardized and renamed column names for better clarity and consistency throughout the analysis. Subsequently, I visualized the data using various charts and graphs to uncover patterns and trends in terrorist activities globally. This visualization included the distribution of attacks over time, geographical hotspots, and the frequency of different attack types. Through these visualizations, I identified key insights, such as the most affected regions, prevalent attack methods, and significant terrorist groups. This analysis provided a comprehensive overview of global terrorism patterns, enhancing my skills in python, data analysis, data handling and visualization.
